* Installation
You can use my Emacs config anytime; the installation is pretty simple.

#+BEGIN_VERSE
*Note*: I won't suggest you use it without understanding the code.
#+END_VERSE

- First, get rid of your =~/.emacs.d= and =~/.emacs=.
- Run =git clone git@bugswriter.com:~/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d=
- Open Emacs with fingers crossed!

* Package Management
Emacs is like an operating system; it is highly extensible. You can install new functionality by just installing a package, similar to how you do it in an OS. You can also configure these programs by changing some Elisp variables.

#+BEGIN_VERSE
An average Emacs user can easily end up installing 100+ packages.
#+END_VERSE

** Melpa
- *Reference*: https://www.melpa.org/

By default, Emacs contains a limited number of package choices. This is why we need Melpa. It's a package repository for Emacs.

#+BEGIN_VERSE
MELPA is an ELPA-compatible package repository that contains an enormous number of useful Emacs packages.
#+END_VERSE

Think of it like the VSCode Plugin Marketplace (eww).

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'package)
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)

(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
(package-initialize)
#+END_SRC

** Package Manager
- /Reference: https://jwiegley.github.io/use-package/
The use-package macro allows you to isolate package configuration in your .emacs file in a way that is both performance-oriented and, well, tidy.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
  (package-refresh-contents)
  (package-install 'use-package))
#+END_SRC

* Better Appearance
** Basic Interface Settings

- Disable dialog boxes:
  This setting disables the display of dialog boxes, such as confirmation or warning pop-ups, in Emacs. It allows for a smoother and uninterrupted workflow.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq use-dialog-box nil)
  #+END_SRC

- Disable file dialogs:
  This setting disables the use of file selection dialogs in Emacs. Instead, Emacs will rely on command-line or programmatic methods for file operations.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq use-file-dialog nil)
  #+END_SRC

- Disable backup files:
  By setting this variable to `nil`, Emacs will not create backup files. This helps to avoid cluttering the file system with unnecessary backup copies.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq make-backup-files nil)
  #+END_SRC

- Disable auto-save:
  Auto-save automatically saves buffer contents periodically in case of unexpected Emacs or system crashes. However, if you prefer to disable this feature, you can set this variable to `nil`.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq auto-save-default nil)
  #+END_SRC

- Hide menu bar:
  This setting hides the menu bar in Emacs, providing more vertical space for your text and reducing visual distractions.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (menu-bar-mode -1)
  #+END_SRC

- Hide tool bar:
  This setting hides the tool bar, which contains various icons and shortcuts, in Emacs. It further maximizes the available space for editing and reduces clutter.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (tool-bar-mode -1)
  #+END_SRC

- Hide fringes:
  Fringes are the narrow areas on the left and right sides of the Emacs window. By disabling them, you can utilize the full width of the window for your text.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (fringe-mode -1)
  #+END_SRC

- Hide scroll bar:
  Emacs provides a scroll bar for navigating through the buffer. If you prefer a more minimalistic interface, you can hide the scroll bar with this setting.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (scroll-bar-mode -1)
  #+END_SRC

- Enable subword navigation:
  Subword navigation allows moving the cursor through CamelCase or snake_case words more intelligently. This setting enables subword navigation globally in Emacs.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-subword-mode 1)
  #+END_SRC

- Use y-or-n-p for prompts:
  By default, Emacs prompts for user confirmation using 'yes' or 'no.' This setting changes it to use 'y' or 'n' for shorter and faster responses.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defalias 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)
  #+END_SRC

** Theme
The =ef-themes= package is an Emacs package that provides a collection of visually appealing themes for Emacs. It enhances the visual experience of Emacs by offering different color schemes and styles that can be applied to the editor.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package ef-themes
  :if window-system
  :ensure t
  :config
  ;; Enable the theme
  (load-theme 'ef-winter t))
#+END_SRC

** Font
I love =JetBrains Mono=. Best for programming. Using it since 2018. Make sure to install it in your system. I use Arch, so I run =sudo pacman -S ttf-jetbrains-mono=.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist
             '(font . "JetBrains Mono-14"))
#+END_SRC  
* Editing Features
** Hungry Delete
- /Reference: https://github.com/nflath/hungry-delete/

Hungry Delete is a minor-mode that causes deletion to delete all whitespace in the direction you are deleting. Works exactly like c-hungry-delete-mode, which is where the code was from. This just packages it up to be easier to use in other modes.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (use-package hungry-delete
    :ensure t
    :defer t
    :config (global-hungry-delete-mode))
#+END_SRC

* Better Emacs

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package mood-line
  :ensure t
  :if window-system
  :init
  (mood-line-mode))
#+END_SRC

** Command Menu
After pressing =M-x=, Emacs users see a prompt below; this prompt allows us to run any command within Emacs. This is what I loved about Emacs when I was learning it first. Almost anything, any functionality, any program, everything is a function, and I can access that function by just pressing =M-x=. But memorizing all these commands is hard, also typing it. Emacs does provide tab completion, but it sucks. So we are gonna pull up the Emacs magic and install some packages to make it better.

*** Ido Mode
The Ido package lets you switch between buffers and visit files and directories with a minimum of keystrokes. It is a superset of Iswitchb, the interactive buffer switching package by Stephen Eglen.
- /Reference - https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractivelyDoThings/
#+begin_src elisp

#+END_SRC
*** Python
***** Language Server Protocol
- /Reference: https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-pyright/
Pyright is a fast type checker meant for large Python source bases. It can run
in a “watch” mode and performs fast incremental updates when files are modified.
For python I decided to use pyright language server protocol.
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package lsp-pyright
    :ensure t
    :defer t
    :hook (python-mode . (lambda ()
			   (setq indent-tabs-mode t)
			   (setq tab-width 4)
			   (setq python-indent-offset 4)
			   (company-mode 1)
			   (require 'lsp-pyright)
			   (pyvenv-autoload)
			   (lsp))))
#+end_src
***** Virutal Environment
- /Reference: https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/pyvenv/
This is a simple global minor mode which will replicate the changes done by
virtualenv activation inside Emacs, basically it helps me loading my python
virtualenv for IDE features like autocompletion.
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package pyvenv
    :ensure t
    :defer t)  
#+end_src
I use my self made elisp function, for automatically load python virtualenv,
I always use =env= dir as virtualenv inside project root. So everytime I open
=python-mode= (aka python file), it looks for any =env= dir and load the env.
#+begin_src elisp
  (defun pyvenv-autoload ()
    (require 'pyvenv)
    (require 'projectile)
    (interactive)
    "auto activate venv directory if exists"
    (f-traverse-upwards (lambda (path)
			  (let ((venv-path (f-expand "env" path)))
			    (when (f-exists? venv-path)
			      (pyvenv-activate venv-path))))))
  (add-hook 'python-mode 'pyvenv-autoload)
#+end_src

** Git Integration
I can't use git without /Magit/.
Magit is a complete text-based user interface to Git. It fills the glaring gap
between the Git command-line interface and various GUIs, letting you perform
trivial as well as elaborate version control tasks with just a couple of
mnemonic key presses. Magit looks like a prettified version of what you get
after running a few Git commands but in Magit every bit of visible information
is also actionable to an extent that goes far beyond what any Git GUI provides
and it takes care of automatically refreshing this output when it becomes
outdated. In the background Magit just runs Git commands and if you wish you
can see what exactly is being run, making it possible for you to learn the git
command-line by using Magit.
I ❤ Magit.
